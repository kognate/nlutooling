# What is this?

This is a highly experimental (which is a really nice way of saying bug-ridden and poorly designed)
code playground I'm experimenting with c++ for a watson SDK.   I'm using the NLU api for
a sample because it's still in development.  

# Is there anything safe here?

Well, no.  But there is a relatively complete libcurl method.
